My main passion is <span className='olive-green'>software development</span> but I have interests in a lot of different areas including: <span className=\"olive-green\">\n                    graphic design, web & fullstack development,</span> and <span className=\"olive-green\">cybersecurity</span>. I began my journey of development from one of my favorite hobbies: video games. </p>\n                    <h2 className='dark-green'>Video Games: My start</h2>\n                    <p>\n                    I started writing code and developing games through ROBLOX and their editors, which spurred my fascination with programming and design. I took what I learned from ROBLOX and began learning other programming languages, such as <span className=\"olive-green\">C++</span>, <span className=\"olive-green\">Java</span>, and <span className=\"olive-green\">HTML/CSS</span>. With this knowledge in hand, I was able to create my own projects and ideas. From then on my interest in coding only continued to grow as a fun hobby, which eventually led me into seeking roles in the tech industry.\n                    </p>\n                    <h2 className=\"dark-green\">Where I'm at</h2>\n                    <p>\n                    I am currently attending <span className=\"asu\">Arizona State University</span> studying my Bachelor's degree for <span className=\"olive-green\">Computer Science</span>. I enjoy developing solutions that make a difference and have impact.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    );\n}"],"names":["About","_jsx","className","id","children","_jsxs","src","tall","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
